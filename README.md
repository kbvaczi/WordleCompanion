## WordleCompanion

A tool to help you determine those hard-to-guess words while doing your daily Wordle puzzles.

## How it works

Enter the 5-letter word you guess followed by a the color response provided by Wordle (ex. GYGGB) where G = Green, Y = Yellow, and B = Black (yeah it's actually grey but that would get confusing with Green, wouldn't it?).

The companion will then output a list of potential words for you to try next.

## Example

Enter 5-letter word guessed (ex. JUMPS):
SPARK
Enter 5-letter feedback G=Green Y=Yellow B=Black (ex. GBBYB):
GYBBB
Potential Answers:
[scoop, scope, setup, sheep, sleep, slept, sloop, slope, slump, snipe, snoop, steep, stomp, stoop, stump, sweep, swept, swoop]
